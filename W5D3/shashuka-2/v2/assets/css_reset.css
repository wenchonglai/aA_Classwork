CSS Reset
Download this skeleton. Work out of css_reset.css

Oh no! We've removed the original reset stylesheet! Time to build our own.

Create a file called custom_reset.css.
Clear default margin, padding and border from any elements that we're using in our HTML.
Make sure font properties get inherited.
Remove default styling from lists.
Give text in the body a line-height of 1.5.
Make sure images always take up the width of their parents.
